# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 3, 2017 


**Today's Progress**: Started building Portfolio page on FreeCodeamp.

**Thoughts:** Not much progress at all. Since I am a beginner, and also had 3 weeks gap from learning to code just before the New Year, so was really strugling to start. But managed to write a few lines of code, which seems wrong, and I'm pretty sure will have to be changed later on. But at least that's a start I suppose

### Day 2: January 4, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Strugling with Bootstrap

**Thoughts**: Figured out many ways of how NOT to write code with Bootstrap. Hardly any visible progress

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
