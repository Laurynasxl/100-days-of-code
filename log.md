# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 3, 2017 


**Today's Progress**: Started building Portfolio page on FreeCodeamp.

**Thoughts:** Not much progress at all. Since I am a beginner, and also had 3 weeks gap from learning to code just before the New Year, so was really strugling to start. But managed to write a few lines of code, which I'm pretty sure will have to be changed later on. But at least that's a start I suppose

### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 2)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
