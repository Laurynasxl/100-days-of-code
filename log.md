# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 3, 2017 


**Today's Progress**: Started building Portfolio page on FreeCodeamp.

**Thoughts:** Not much progress at all. Since I am a beginner, and also had 3 weeks gap from learning to code just before the New Year, so was really strugling to start. But managed to write a few lines of code, which seems wrong, and I'm pretty sure will have to be changed later on. But at least that's a start I suppose

### Day 13: January 14, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Profile page completed

**Thoughts** So after approximately 17hrs of coding I finaly managed to complete my portfolio projects. I know a lot of things are still incorrect there, but at the moment I have streched my skills to the limits and spending any more time on this would be waste of time. I will have to go back to this project once I get more knowledge and experience and either fix it or re-build from the scratch.
